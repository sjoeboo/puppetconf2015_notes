==================

Keynote: Luke Kanies
--------------------
"Local, Organic, Artisinal Devops" aka, Portland

* 30K companies, 22 a day start using puppet for the first time
* 3500 modules in the forge
* 1000 paying customers
* 400 employees

Everyone is looking for their own bridge to live under.
Devops is still mostly a theory. Rename sys admins to Devops engineers.
Can't add quaility @ the end. Add quality in the process. Evol backwards from the customer.
Incremental bits of automation.

Puppet Application Orchestrator:
Ryan Coleman:
you can get a lot done with puppet, core infra, app infra, app releases....
* Elevating Puppet:
  * Node Level:
    * Composition (core configs, ldap, ntp, etc etc)
    * Flexability(fact based, move around, resue)
    * Predicability (noop mode etc)
    * Orchestration (relationships)
